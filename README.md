# Template

This is a template for a Deno module.

All source code gets stored under the `src` directory. e2e tests are stored under the e2e_tests folder. The `mod.ts` file serves as interface for functions which are provided by the module. The `cli.ts` file serves as interface for functions which should be executed directly for the module.
